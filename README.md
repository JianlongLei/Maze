# Maze
This the assignment 4 of DPRL course, which is required to solve a maze problem by Q-learning. 
We implement dynamic programming tabular Q-learning, ε-greedy Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN).
Besides, we provide a UI for this problem and our algorithms.

To run the project, you need to follow instructions below:
1. install libraries in the requirements.
2. run the main.py.
3. you will see a window displaying a 3×3 maze.\

4. click "Run" button, then you will see the solution by DP Q-learning and ε-greedy Q-learning.
5. click "Previous" or "Next" button, you can switch between two different mazes.\

6. Click "Run" button again to run DQN in the 5×5 maze. It takes time, so be patient.
